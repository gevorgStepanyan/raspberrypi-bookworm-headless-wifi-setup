# WiFi Setup Service for Raspberry Pi

This service automatically configures and manages WiFi connections on your Raspberry Pi using NetworkManager. No need for a monitor or keyboard. Can directly edit the config file on the SD card from your computer.

## Files

Place these files directly in the root folder of your Raspberry Pi SD card. These will then be available under `/boot/firmware/` when you are on the PI via ssh:

- `wifi_config.txt`: Configuration file for WiFi networks
- `wifi-setup.sh`: Main script that configures WiFi connections
- `wifi-setup.service`: Systemd service file
- `setup-wifi-service.sh`: Installation script

## Installation

1. Copy all files directly to the root folder of your Raspberry Pi micro SD card:

- `wifi_config.txt`
- `wifi-setup.sh`
- `wifi-setup.service`
- `setup-wifi-service.sh`

2. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on.

3. Wait for the Raspberry Pi to boot up.

4. Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH using the following command:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

Or use whatever IP address or network name you have set for the Raspberry Pi.

5. Make the installation script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /boot/firmware/setup-wifi-service.sh
```

6. Run the installation script:

```bash
sudo /boot/firmware/setup-wifi-service.sh
```

7. Edit the WiFi configuration:
   You can edit the configuration file directly on the SD card from your computer. So if you move somewhere to a new wifi you can just plug in the SD card and edit the file to setup a new wifi. No screen required.

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/wifi_config.txt
```

The format you can see in the example file.

```
SSID,password,priority
```

Example:

```
HomeWifi,YourPassword,3
YourIphoneHotSpot,YourPassword,2
YourHotSpot,YourPassword,1
```

Higher priority number = higher priority (tried first).
Automatically connects to the next one if the first one is not available.

If the connection requires more advanced settings (like enterprise wifi), then you can add those settings in the following format:

```
SSID,PASSWORD,priority,email_identity,path_to_cert,altsubject
```

# Miscellaneous

Here some commands that might be useful:

## Logs

Check the logs at:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/wifi-setup.log
```

## Service Management

- Check service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status wifi-setup.service
```

- Restart service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wifi-setup.service
```

- Stop service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop wifi-setup.service
```

- Disable service:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable wifi-setup.service
```

Update and restart the service after a change:

```bash
sudo cp wifi-setup.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo systemctl restart wifi-setup.service
sudo systemctl status wifi-setup.service
sudo journalctl -u wifi-setup.service -f
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the service logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u wifi-setup.service -f
```

2. Verify the configuration file exists:

```bash
ls -l /boot/firmware/wifi_config.txt
```

3. Check NetworkManager status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
```

4. View available WiFi networks:

```bash
nmcli device wifi list
```

5. View all configured networks:

```bash
nmcli connection show | grep wifi
```
